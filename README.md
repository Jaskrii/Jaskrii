  My Bio

Hi, I'm Jaskri, I'm 15 I live in Parma, obviously I teach in a technical institute.
I entered this world of programming because I liked it right away at the age of 10 and still in these years I am studying and learning to program.
I currently have 2 projects open including first and bedwars and second an AC (anticheat mc) so don't expect big things from me
